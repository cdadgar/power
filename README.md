# power

module: LM2596
type: buck  high DC to low DC
Input voltage: 4.5-35V
Output voltage: 1.5-35V(Adjustable)
Output current:  Rated current is 2A, maximum 3A (Additional heat sink is required)
Conversion Efficiency:  Up to 92% (higher the output voltage, the higher the efficiency)
Short Circuit Protection: Current limiting, since the recovery
Load Regulation: ± 0.5%
Voltage Regulation: ± 2.5%

notes:  these have a 220uf 35V input capaitor
NOT suitable for air conditioner or sprinkler power conversion projects (transformer 24 VAC)

Input: 3V - 6V
Output: 6V - 12V (Module is ordered with decided output voltage)
Max output: 5W
multimeter says this is really 27.7 VAC
after a single diode for regulation, I measure 36.5 VDC (which is above the max input for the module)

----------------------------------------------------

there is another version of this module called LM2597HV
its all the same specs as the LM2496 module exept the max input is 60V
notes:  these have a 100uf 60V input capaitor
suitable for air conditioner or sprinkler projects (24VAC)

module: SD XMDZ
type: boost  low DC to high DC
review: https://lygte-info.dk/review/Converter%20DC-DC%203-6V%20to%209V%205W%20UK.html
Input: 3V - 6V
Output: 6V - 12V (Module is ordered with decided output voltage)
Max output: 5W
notes: not sure what voltage are the ones I have
I have 3 of these modules...never used one in a project
